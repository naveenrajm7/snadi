	    I am an Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://www.cs.ualberta.ca/" target="_blank">Department of Computing Science</a> at the <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/">University of Alberta</a>. I am also a Canada Research Chair in Software Reuse. My research is in the area of software maintenance and reuse, where I focus on two directions: 
        <ul>
        <li><b>Software Product Lines (SPLs):</b> I develop techniques to help developers maintain their SPLs, or highly configurable systems (e.g., find configuration-related bugs). I also develop techniques to help developers migrate similar existing systems into an SPL.</li>
        <li><b>Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)</b>: My goal is to improve software reuse by helping developers use existing software libraries more effectively. I conduct empirical studies to understand the problems developers have when using APIs and the kind of information that helps them make better decisions. I then design automated techniques to solve these problems, such as recommending relevant code snippets or detecting API misuses. </li>
        </ul>
