	    I am the <a href="http://www.chairs-chaires.gc.ca/chairholders-titulaires/profile-eng.aspx?profileId=4393">Canada Research Chair in Software Reuse</a> and an Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://www.cs.ualberta.ca/" target="_blank">Department of Computing Science</a> at the <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/">University of Alberta</a>, where I lead the <a href="{{ "/smr" | prepend: site.baseurl}}"">Software Maintenance and Reuse (SMR) Lab </a>. My research focuses on software maintenance and reuse in two directions: 
        <ul>
        <li><b>Software Product Lines (SPLs):</b> I develop techniques to help developers maintain their SPLs, or highly configurable systems (e.g., find configuration-related bugs). I also develop techniques to help developers migrate similar existing systems into an SPL.</li>
        <li><b>Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)</b>: My goal is to improve software reuse by helping developers use existing software libraries more effectively. I conduct empirical studies to understand the problems developers have when using APIs and the kind of information that helps them make better decisions. I then design automated techniques to solve these problems, such as recommending relevant code snippets or detecting API misuses. </li>
        </ul>
        For more information about my research, please check SMR's <a href="{{ "/smr/research" |  prepend: site.baseurl }}">projects</a> and <a href="{{ "/smr/publications" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">publications</a> pages.
