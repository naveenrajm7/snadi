# Analyzing Variability Implementation Mechanisms for C++

## Overview 

The goal of this project is to help C++ developers with their variability implementation decisions. Specifically, in collaboration with IBM, we explore the [IBM OMR]() project, which uses static polymorphism as its main variability implementation strategy. We develop tools to help OMR developers understand the variability in their code, and also help them decide about the best variability implementation strategy to use (e.g., static vs. dynamic polymorphism).

In the context of this project, we are additionally exploring how we can implement a variability aware analysis of C++ code on top of Clang.
