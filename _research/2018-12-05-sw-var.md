short-desc: Software reuse is essential to build software faster. Version-control systems and social coding platforms offer more systematic reuse mechanisms, such as pull requests and cross-project traceability. In this project, we explore how software families (i.e., a group of related software systems that vary slightly in terms of the functionality they offer) make use of these mechanisms. As a first step, we study variability management in the Android ecosystem.
