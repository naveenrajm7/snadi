# Interested in Joining SMR?

The following information is important for prospective students.

![Software Maintenance and Reuse Lab]({{ "/resources/images/logo_web_color_2400_frame_transparent.png" }}){: .group-logo } 

* I'm always looking for students at all levels (Master's, PhD, and undergrad RAs). I could also potentially consider exceptional post-docs whose interests overlap with mine.
* I'm currently interested in the areas of code recommenders (helping with API usage and documentation -- including security APIs), software merging, and support for highly configurable software (see my work on software product lines). I can also be opportunistic: if you have a related software engineering topic that sounds interesting to me, feel free to email me with specifics.
* Prospective PhD Students should have already obtained a Master's degree in software engineering or a related field and **published at least one peer-reviewed paper in a software engineering venue**. If you would like to work under my supervision, send me the a **short** summary that (1) shows you have already looked at my previous projects or read some of my papers, (2) tells me the research direction(s) you are interested in, and (3) mentions any relevant background you might have for these directions. I will usually have a Skype call with promising candidates. The call might include discussing a particular research paper. I will also give you a programming task.
* Prospective Master's students can contact me after applying to the UofA Master's program. Note that Master's students can be admitted unattached to a supervisor. If you plan to send a generic, automated email to all faculty members, please take me off your list. If you are going to email me, then at least go through my website and tell me which particular projects are you interested in (please do not just list keywords). In fact, you should do the same for any potential supervisor you plan to email. Few people would find generic emails very flattering :-) I will give a paper review task and a programming task and then arrange a Skype call afterwards.
* **To show me you have actually taken the time to read this page, include the word "Winterfell" at the beginning of your email.**
